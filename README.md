# WUEnvironment

<p align="center">
‚ÑπÔ∏è WUEnvironment allows to detect the kind of app build in build time [Debug | Adhoc | Release] and also manage API environments.
</p>

## Features

- [x] ‚ÑπÔ∏è WUEnvironment detects the app build time in build time
- [x] ‚ÑπÔ∏è WUEnvironment handles API environments

## Example

The example application is the best way to see `WUEnvironment` in action. Simply open the `WUEnvironment.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

WUEnvironment is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
bash
pod 'WUEnvironment'
```

And very important, it's needed to add in the project podfile the following:

```
post_install do |installer|

    target = installer.pods_project.targets.find{|t| t.to_s == "WUEnvironment"}
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        puts "Setting Swift flags for configuration #{config.name}".green

        s = config.build_settings['OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS']

        if s == nil
            s = [ '$(inherited)' ]
        end

        if config.name == 'Debug'
            s.push('-DCONFIGURATION_Debug')
        end

        if config.name == 'Demo'
            s.push('-DCONFIGURATION_Adhoc')
        end

        if config.name == 'Release'
            s.push('-DCONFIGURATION_Release')
        end

        config.build_settings['OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS'] = s
        puts "Set flags: #{s}".yellow

    end

end
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate WUEnvironment into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "Vicente Crespo/WUEnvironment"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `WUEnvironment.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/wundercar/environment-ios.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate WUEnvironment into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.
